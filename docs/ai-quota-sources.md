# AI Quota Sources

PhoneMonitor quota collection must be independent. Cockpit Tools can be used as a research reference, but PhoneMonitor must not depend on Cockpit processes, ports, caches, or private local storage.

## New-user paths (same text is shown on the Quotas page)

### Codex → VibeDeck

1. Install/sign in Codex on the **same Windows PC** as the Host.
2. Use Codex so `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\sessions\**\*.jsonl` gets a `rate_limits` event.
3. Open **額度 → Codex → ↻**.
4. No import button and no Codex OAuth — local scan only.

### AGY → VibeDeck

1. Configure Google OAuth on the Host (`AGY_GOOGLE_*` env or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\PhoneMonitor\secrets\agy-google-oauth.json`).
2. Open **額度 → AGY → +** and finish Google sign-in in the **PC** browser.
3. Press **↻** to refresh Antigravity quota APIs.
4. Optional one-time import from `%USERPROFILE%\.antigravity_cockpit\accounts\` via `POST /api/quotas/agy/import`.

## Current Providers

### Codex

Status: implemented.

Sources:

- `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\sessions\**\*.jsonl`
- `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\auth*.json`
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\PhoneMonitor\quotas\codex\accounts\*.json`

Codex session logs include `event_msg` payloads with `rate_limits`. PhoneMonitor reads recent session files from newest to oldest and scans the tail of each JSONL file for the newest rate-limit snapshot.

Codex `rate_limits` events do not include the account email. PhoneMonitor uses Codex-owned `auth*.json` files only to identify seen accounts by non-token metadata such as account id, email, and plan type. It does not store Codex tokens.

When PhoneMonitor sees a usable Codex quota snapshot, it writes the normalized snapshot to:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\PhoneMonitor\quotas\codex\accounts\*.json
```

This lets the quota page remember multiple Codex accounts after they have been used at least once. Accounts seen in Codex auth files but not yet associated with a quota snapshot are shown as `source-needed` until that account produces a fresh `rate_limits` event.

Known fields:

- `primary.used_percent`
- `primary.window_minutes`
- `primary.resets_at`
- `secondary.used_percent`
- `secondary.window_minutes`
- `secondary.resets_at`

This is not a direct account API call, but it is independent and good enough for the first quota page because it reflects the latest quota snapshot Codex itself received.

Codex multi-account discovery does not read `.cockpit_codex_auth*`. PhoneMonitor only trusts Codex-owned session/auth data and its own normalized quota cache.

### Claude Code

Status: **removed from product surface**.

Earlier builds only detected local Claude install/config and showed a tab with no way to import real usage into VibeDeck. That dead-end path is no longer returned by `/api/quotas` and the Claude tab is gone.

AGY’s own “Claude” bucket (via Antigravity) is unrelated — that still comes from AGY OAuth/quota APIs.

If Claude Code quota is added later, it needs a real authenticated usage source plus store/import UI, not install detection alone.

### AGY

Status: implemented from PhoneMonitor's own token/cache store.

AGY CLI exists at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\agy\bin\agy.exe`.

Current source:

- Token store: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\PhoneMonitor\quotas\agy\accounts\*.json`
  - Refresh tokens are stored as `refresh_token_protected`, encrypted with Windows DPAPI `CurrentUser`.
  - Legacy plaintext `refresh_token` files are read only for migration and are rewritten encrypted on import.
- Quota cache: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\PhoneMonitor\quotas\agy\cache\*.json`
- Refreshes Google OAuth access tokens, then calls the Antigravity quota API directly.
- New accounts can be added through PhoneMonitor's OAuth loopback flow.
  - Start endpoint opens the PC browser, even when triggered from the phone UI.
  - Callback returns to `http://127.0.0.1:{port}` with the OAuth query string.
  - The flow uses PKCE and requests `openid email https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform`.
  - Google OAuth client credentials are **not** shipped in source. Configure either:
    - Environment variables `AGY_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `AGY_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, or
    - `%LOCALAPPDATA%\PhoneMonitor\secrets\agy-google-oauth.json` (see `docs/agy-google-oauth.example.json`).
- Maps `3p-5h` and `3p-weekly` to `AGY Claude`.
- Maps `gemini-5h` and `gemini-weekly` to `AGY Gemini`.
- These percentages are already remaining quota, not used quota.

Antigravity Cockpit data is now only a one-time import fallback. PhoneMonitor may import refresh tokens from:

```text
%USERPROFILE%\.antigravity_cockpit\accounts\*.json
```

After import, the formal quota source is the PhoneMonitor token store and cache above. PhoneMonitor no longer reads
Cockpit quota snapshots as the displayed quota source.

Manual import endpoint:

```text
POST /api/quotas/agy/import
```

OAuth endpoints:

```text
POST /api/quotas/agy/oauth/start
GET /?state=...&code=...
GET /api/quotas/agy/oauth/callback
```

The `/api/quotas/agy/oauth/callback` route is a debug/manual fallback. The normal Google loopback redirect uses `/`.

AGY account actions:

```text
POST /api/quotas/agy/cli/open
POST /api/quotas/agy/account/delete
```

`/api/quotas/agy/cli/open?open=false` validates the selected account and writes the launcher without opening a visible terminal.

The quota card toolbar uses:

- `+` for AGY OAuth sign-in / add account.
- `▶` to open AGY CLI with the selected account context.
- `↻` to refresh quotas.
- `⌫` to delete the selected AGY account from PhoneMonitor's token/cache store.

## Endpoint

PhoneMonitor exposes:

```text
GET /api/quotas
```

Refresh and import helpers:

```text
POST /api/quotas/refresh
POST /api/quotas/agy/import
POST /api/quotas/agy/oauth/start
POST /api/quotas/agy/cli/open
POST /api/quotas/agy/account/delete
```

The response is normalized into providers with `Primary` and `Secondary` quota windows when available. Providers that are installed but not wired return `State = "source-needed"` instead of pretending to have data.

The phone UI renders quota as a dedicated page, not inside the Glance Board sideboard. The page should reserve action space for OAuth/account switching even before those flows are implemented.
